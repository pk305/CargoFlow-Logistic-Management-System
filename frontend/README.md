Logistics TMS is a Logistics software for handling transportion services.

- **Declarative:** Logistics TMS makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and Logistics TMS will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
- **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
